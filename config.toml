    # email. Visitors can send up to a 1000 emails each month for free.
    #
    # What you need to do for the setup?
    #
    # - set your email address under 'email' below (uncomment it first)
    # - upload the generated site to your server
    # - send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
    # - click the confirm link in the email from www.formspree.io
    # - you're done. Happy mailing!
